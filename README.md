# drl_practice
Practice the Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) with the OpenAI's gymnasium.

## How to practice
Check the [Command Guide](./hands_on/README.md) doc, which provides the
step-by-step commands for installing and running every exercise.
The things you need to do:
1. Create the python env
2. For a exercise, implement the function for every `NotImplementedError` in the `*_train.py` file .
3. then train it.
4. [Optional] generate the video and push the video/result to the HuggingFace.


## Reference
I implement this repo after I study the HuggingFace's
[DRL course](https://huggingface.co/learn/deep-rl-course/unit0/introduction),
because I want to have a better understanding through the coding. So, some code
is came from or bassed on the course code. Thanks for this greate course.
